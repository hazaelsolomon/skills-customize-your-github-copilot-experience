# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Practice designing endpoints, handling requests, and returning JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project and create a main application file.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a file `main.py` with a basic FastAPI app
- Run the app locally and access the default docs at `/docs`

### 🛠️ Design API Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints for managing a simple resource (e.g., books, users, tasks).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Implement at least three endpoints: GET (list), POST (create), and GET (by ID)
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Return JSON responses

### 🛠️ Test Your API

#### Description
Test your endpoints using the interactive docs or a tool like curl/Postman.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Demonstrate successful requests and responses for each endpoint
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., resource not found)
- Example input/output in code blocks if helpful
